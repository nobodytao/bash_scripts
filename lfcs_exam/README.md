<h2>Exam Questions Script</h2>
<br><br>
<b>examquest.sh</b> is an executable script designed to sequentially present LFCS exam questions stored in files numbered 1 to 26. After each question is posed, the corresponding answer is displayed.
<br><br>
Answer files are housed in the lfcs_exam_answers directory, each file named with the same numeric identifier as its respective question file.
<br><br>
<b>Usage:</b>
<br>
To initiate the script without any arguments, it will start from the first question:
<br>
<b>./examquest.sh</b>
<br>
To initiate the script and begin from a specific question number, use the following format:
<br>
<b>./examquest.sh 15</b>
<br><br>
In this example, the script will start from question 15. You can customize the number based on your preferences.
<br><br>
<b>Extending Questions and Answers</b>
<br>
You can add any number of questions and answers without altering the script. The script dynamically reads the list of files in the directory. Ensure that both question and answer files have numeric names.
<br>
For instance, you can add new questions by creating a file named "27" for the question and "27" for the corresponding answer.
